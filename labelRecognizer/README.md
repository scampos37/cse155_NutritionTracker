## Abstract

Current techniques for tracking nutritional data require undesirable amounts of either time or man-
power. People must choose between tediously recording and updating dietary information or de-
pending on unreliable crowd-sourced or costly maintained databases. Our project looks to overcome
these pitfalls by providing a programming interface for image analysis that will read and report the
information present on a nutrition label directly.
Our solution provides a library that combines image pre-processing, optical character recog-
nition, and post-processing techniques to pull the relevant information from an image of a nutrition
label. We apply an understanding of a nutrition labelâ€™s content and data organization to approach
the accuracy of traditional data-entry methods. Our system currently provides around 80% accuracy
for most label images, and we will continue to work to improve our accuracy.
